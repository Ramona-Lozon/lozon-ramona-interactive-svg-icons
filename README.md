# lozon-ramona-interactive-svg-icons

welcome to my SVG insteractivity project site!

Although in class i'm quite sure that it was said that we didnt need to use themed logos that we will be able to use for our brand, i figured it wise to build some that i will be able to use later in the FIP.

I tried to think of which icons I would actually use on the website, such as a home icon, a user icon, a search icon, etc. and tried to have their transitions make them stand out.

below is the rubric for this assignment, I tried to follow it and what you said in class as close as I could.

thank you!

Interactive SVG Icons
Each Student must build a branded, scalable themed icon set using Adobe Illustrator. Export each icon from Illustrator as an SVG. Use the SVGs as assets on the FIP/Brand Revival site (think icons for different flavours or ingredients). Add some simple interactivity with JavaScript. Use HTML (and the appropriate elements) to include a descrip>on of the icon set.

Assignment Requirements
Use Terminal, Git and Github to create the project structure and a linked repository. Create a minimum of 6 SVG icons in Illustrator. Use CSS to organize the icons on an HTML page (products)in your FIP. You can choose how you want to implement this - as an image tag source, as an SVG tag, or using the object tag.

Use CSS interactions or transitions to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example, reverse all of the colours or add a drop shadow, etc). When clicked log a message to the console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and displayed with a JavaScript string template and variable (refer to the class example).

Push the finished files to your repo; include a readme that describes the project. Merge everything to the main branch and submit a link to the dropbox on FOL - a .txt file is fine.
